        "paragraph": "<p class='a'>The centaur is an overall good MPC choice, making excellent martial oriented characters from lv. 0, ECL 6. It's relative low base attack bonus delays iterative attacks, meanwhile it should hit harder and may use its natural attacks as backup. Centaurs start with no armor or shield proficiency. In respect to weapons, before any class levels, you have access to simple weapons, longswords and longbows, which should suffice. Despite its size, base reach is just 5 ft.<br><br> Centaur don’t automatically speak common, you should expend a couple of skill points to do so, if initial INT does not suffice for the extra languague known.<br><br> A centaur persuing a full caster class would be 6 levels behind a regular PC, for the first several levels such character will have to fill a martial-support role, as levels go by it could aproach a true caster role. It's mental modifiers lean them to WIS based casters and deters them from INT based ones, namely the powerful Wizard.<br><br> Regarding centaur and 'Mounted Combat' chain feat: it is unclear if centaurs count as having 'Mounted Combat' per the election of feats such as 'Ride by Attack', being the Zelekuth entry the precedent. If it were it would render 'Spring Attack' much less useful for this MPC, still both feats would be different, 'Ride by Attack' requires charging and 'Spring Attack' requires the 'Attack' standard action. If the centaur does not count as having 'Mounted Combat' it looses access to the whole chain, as it cannot really mount anything. As always it's up to the DM, maybe you can arrange to pick 'Mounted Combat' as a tax before picking other feats in the chain but be able to use those feats without being mounted.</p>",
