        "paragraph": "<p class='a'>The centaur is an overall good MPC choice, making excellent martial oriented characters from lv. 0, ECL 6. It's relative low base attack bonus delays iterative attacks, meanwhile it should hit harder and may use its natural attacks as backup. Centaurs start with no armor or shield proficiency. In respect to weapons, before any class levels, you have access to simple weapons, longswords and longbows, which should suffice. Despite its size, base reach is just 5 ft.<br><br> Centaur don’t automatically speak common, you should expend a couple of skill points to do so, if initial INT does not suffice for the extra languague known.<br><br> A centaur persuing a full caster class would be 6 levels behind a regular PC, for the first several levels such character will have to fill a martial-support role, as levels go by it could aproach a true caster role. It's mental modifiers lean them to WIS based casters and deters them from INT based ones, namely the powerful Wizard.</p><p class='b'> Regarding centaur and 'Mounted Combat' chain feat: it is unclear if centaurs count as having 'Mounted Combat' per the election of feats such as 'Ride by Attack', being the Zelekuth entry the precedent. If it were it would render 'Spring Attack' much less useful for this MPC, still both feats would be different, 'Ride by Attack' requires charging and 'Spring Attack' requires the 'Attack' standard action. If the centaur does not count as having 'Mounted Combat' it looses access to the whole chain, as it cannot really mount anything. As always it's up to the DM, maybe you can arrange to pick 'Mounted Combat' as a tax before picking other feats in the chain but be able to use those feats without being mounted.</p>",

        "paragraph": "<p class='a'>Lycanthropy is a template that can be applied to any humaniod or giant, I'll consider only natural lycanthropy as I find it easier to roleplay, in my opinion afflicted lycanthropy is precisely that, an affliction. Althought, at a high ECL, you can build a playable character based on high a 'Control Shape' modifier, the character would be used to the affliction making it a boon.<br><br> A lycantrope can make an exellect martial character and may find some utility, and a lot of flavor, on it's alternate form feature. Scent is a simple, yet powerful, ability that offers aid fooling ilusions, detecting enemies and determining their position. It is relatively easy for a PC to bypass damage reduction '10/silver' but not so for enemy monsters, although informed and resourceful NPC's could access it with ease. Spell casting classes are hard to follow since lycanthopes have trouble completing spell components and retaing the template's best features at the same time, more on the matter later on, still it can be achieved to some extent by 'Silent Spell'. Also, lycanthopes tend to have inferior saving throws, specifically WILL, try to compensate.<br><br> A lycantrope can assume 3 different shapes:<br> <b> - Base Creature:</b> this shape doesn't recieves most of this template features, it only retains a minor natural armor bonus, a WIS bonus, feats, scent and low light vision. But it's fully capable of spell casting, if applicable.<br><b> - Base Animal:</b> this form gets the creature's ability score modifiers, size, movement, natural attacks, base natural armor, extraordinary abilities and attacks (if any) and damage reduction. In animal shape the character cannot speak or complete any spell components (verbal, somatic and material). Also it's harder to gear up. <br><b> - Hybrid Shape:</b> this form combines the base creature and the base animal, it gains of the base animal features, except special extraordinary attacks (it keeps extraordinary abilities) and movement modes which inherits from the base creature. It assumes whichever size is larger between both. It exchanges any natural attacks of the base animal for a fixed bite/claw/claw, damage dice base on size. This form has hands, it can use weapons. But, it cannot speak, at least not well enough to complete verbal spell components.<br><br> Picking Base Creature: you can choose among all humaniods and giants. Since this character will be already facing a +3 LA and several racial hit dice further of these are better avoided as they would stack. All of the base creature's features would translate to hybrid form but keep in mind that in this shape base natural armor will be the greatest between base creature and base animal, making base creature's natural armor less appealing. Also, in animal shape the character looses all of the base creature extraordinary attacks and movement modes.<br><br> Picking Base Animal: this choice defines added racial hit-dice, ability score modifiers for animal and hybrid form, feats and, of course, the animal shape. Larger animals will result in greater natural armor, STR and CON, besides improved reach in hybrid shape. Smaller animals will provide increased DEX. The manual offers 7 examples (wolf, dire wolf, grizzly bear, boar, dire boar, dire rat and tiger) but you could pick any animal on the book if it is within one size category of the base creature, ask your DM.</p><p class='b'>On total hit points: for a lycantrope total hit points are calculated in a particular way, this character CON changes between shapes but its hit points don't. The animal CON modifier only affects the animal hit dice of the character while the base creature modifier affects all its whole character level. For example: a human werewolf (+4 CON on animal/hybrid shape), fighter 2, with a base CON of 14 get 2d10 (2 fighter hit dice) plus 2*2 (fighter level multiplied by constitution modifier) plus 2d8 (2 animal hit dice) plus 2*4 (total animal hit dice multiplied by improved constitution modifier).</p>",

        "paragraph": "<p class='a'>Xills most defining trait is multiple limbs, potentially allowing exotic combinations like: four weapon fighting; dual wiel longbows; somatic spell completition while holding a shield and a two hander; climbing a rope and reloading a crossbow. While these kind of seemingly mundane benefits are inmmediate there are several fancy perks completely subject to DM approval and desing like 'multitasking' or 'more advantageous two-weapon attacks'. I'll dive into this later on.<br><br> A Xill PC gets high natural armor and, more importantly, high spell resistance. At starting ECL, 9, an enemy caster, say caster level 9, would have a 45% of beating 21 spell resistance. Although it is not clear if the Xill's spell resistance scales as it levels up, I'll assume it does as a DM myself, if it doesn't it still is a nice ability but it looses relevance as level goes by.<br><br> This monster has 'improved grab' on a claw attacks with an added grapple check bonus on each claw hit. 'Improved Grab' is limit to enemies at least one size smaller, unless 'otherwise noted', ask your DM about this limitation. Medium size severely limits grapple tactics, you could reach a +8 bonus but it's unlikely since it requires a 'full attack action' and four claw hits. On a succesful grapple you get a chance to paralyse your opponent, the ability is listed as a 'venom', probably making it a poison effect, and gets no racial bonus on it's DC. All this makes 'Paralysis' hard to use effectively but if you manage to land it is an encounter winner.<br><br> 'Planewalk' is a very interesting ability with toons of utlity and even combat use. The material plane is visible, though distorted, from the ethereal plane while 'A traveler on the Ethereal Plane is invisible, incorporeal, and utterly silent to someone on the Material Plane' making scouting safe, besides etheral plane dwellers and enemies with active 'True Seeing' focusing on the etheral plane. 'Planewalk' allows planar travel, potentialy to more destinations than the material and ethereal planes since the ethereal plane it's 'often connected to other planes', DM call, could be regulated by a 'The Planes'/'Geography' check. Also it offers a reliable way to surprise enemies in combat but keep in mind that returing to the etheral plane takes 2 vulnerable rounds. 'Planewalk' can be shared with party memmbers one at a time.<br><br> <b>On multiple limbs: </b> the following bases on the assupmtion that multiple limb could allow extra benefits besides those explicit stated on the Xill's monster manual entry. This trait is adressed on 'Savage Species', 3.0 content, you will find information on page 43, 'Three or more hands' and in the feats section. I think in this particular case non-Core content it's call for since it is not adressed at all besides a lone feat in the monster manual. Even if your DM allows the Xill character but doesn't permits the following options you could still play a solid Xill. <br><br> <b>- More advantegeous two-weapon attacks: </b> the concept implies that as the strenght modifier varies wielding a weapon one-handed versus two-handed if more limbs are used on a properly desinged weapon the strenght modifier should vary too. This is hinted in the 'Alter Self' spell description, last sentence of fifth paragraph: 'A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal'. Since extra limbs do grant additional weapon attacks I'm gonna assume they also grant the later, both benefits are beyond the effect of 'Alter Self' though. <br><br><b>- Improved Multiweapon fighting: </b> the issue is simple, while there is a chain follow up for two weapon fighting there is only one feat for multiweapon fighting. This is also adressed in the epic character handbook, as non-epic feats. <br><br><b>- Multitasking: </b> there is a feat with the same name in 'Savage Species', the feat requires high investment, it basically allows separate actions for every pair of arms, as long as the actions don't overlap. For example with 4 arms, cast a spell and attack <b>or</b> attack and use a magic device. But, for example, you couldn't cast 2 spells simultaneusly. <b>I would not allow this feat</b>, I feel that an extra pair of arms doesn't automaticaly grants an extra partial mindset. Besides the number of limbs, indepent coordination of them it's extraordinary, much as a human being would be capable of writing simultaneusly with both hands different content. If 'Multitasking' exists in my game, it wouldn't apply only to creatures with at least 2 pair of arms. A human cleric needs only one hand free for somatic completition, with 'Multitasking' he could cast a spell and attack simultaneusly with the morningstar he's holding with his other hand.</p>",

        "paragraph": "<p class='a'>At starting ECL, 11, an Archon Hound would have 5 hit dice less than regular PC, without consistent special attacks, abilities or great ability score modifiers the only role it can fill it's martial support. Later on, persuing a caster class would be very challenging, facing a -11 caster level relative to a regular PC and possibly disminishing any chance of martial effectivness.<br><br> The Archon Hound does have strong points: <br> <b> - Resilence:</b> natural armor, spell resistance and damage reduction gives it an overall good survivability. Althoght there are many monsters that automatically bypass its damage reduction (/evil) most don't. Inmunities to electricity and petrification are very nice to have but situational, when petrification does come up it's usually the most challenging part of the encounter. <br> <b> - Aura of Menace:</b> it's an excellent untyped debuff but you will need a boost in CHA (keeping the DC relevant) and avoid getting hit (mantaining the effect) to get the most of it. It requires no particular action from the Archon to activate, just being in close range (20 ft.), afterwards it could retreat and any affected creature would remain so. <br><b> - Greater Teleport:</b> I really like this perk although it is limited to the Archon it self and 50 lbs of gear, that's how much a regular full plate weights. You can circumbet easily this limits with mithril gear and/or a 'Bag of Holding'. You can use this ability at will to move almost anywhere in your current plane, you need only a reliable description of the destination. This allows tons of off-combat utility, from scouting to a blink re-suply from your sanctum or favorite metropolis. In combat it gives perfect positioning and almost sure escape from an on going area spell effect, a grapple, etc. Being a 'Supernatural Ability' it does <b>NOT</b> requires a 'Concentration' check and it doesn't generates attacks of oportunity, it still requires a standard action. Of course there are several ways to prevent teleport, expect important areas to be warded by spells such as a 'Dimensional Anchor' binded 'Hallow'/'Unhallow', 'Forbiddance' and at high level 'Dimensional Lock'. Also, by 'Teleport' spell description, 'Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible', so it's DM call, as usual. You could try to teleport someone with you inside a 'Portable Hole' (be very careful with these and bags of holding), allowing party travel, ask your DM. Luckily when 'Greater Teleport' fails you just reapear in the same spot. <br><b> - Circle of Protection Against Evil:</b> this is a nice, continous effect that refreshs itself and it is shared with nearby allies. It gives some minor deflection and resistance vs evil (possibly not relevant for party members), blocks possesion and supresses mind control (this is great) and help against non-good summoned creatures. Still, with a caster level equal to the Archons hit dice, there is a considerable chance that summoned creatures with spell resistance will overcome the warding effect.<br><br> The Hound Archon has other useful traits: natural attacks, scent, permanent 'Tongues', 'Aid' at will (always keep it up on yourself and apply to allies in preparation for combat), 'Continual Flame' at will (not very useful to a character with Darkvision and Low light vision but it still can counter 'Darkness') and 'Change Shape' into a canine ranging small to large size (because of the natue of 'Change Shape' the Archon retains the ability scores of its original form, so this is mostly role playing, check with your DM what happens to your gear).</p><p class='b'>On alignment and roleplaying: a Hound Archon has 'Good' and 'Lawful' subtypes, this doesn't necesarily means its alignment is 'Lawful Good', it could have any alignment but any effect that depend on alignment affects the Archon as being 'Lawful Good', no matter what its alignment actually is. Also, any weapon it wields and natural attacks are treated as 'Good' and 'Lawful' aligned in regards of overcoming damage reduction.</p>",

That said, Bralanis can make great martial oriented characters. A full caster career is possible with proper considerations, careful spell selection and use of 'Staffs', although I would stick with a martial/support role if so. <br><br> This monster has great ability scores modifiers, an impresive +32 if put all together, not penalties at all, distribution inclined to physical stats. Bralanis are quite durable thanks to their damage reduction (10/cold iron or evil), minor resistance to fire and cold, immunity to electricity and petrification, natural armor and 'Spell Resistance'. It's unclear if this monster spell resitance scalates as it gains levels, if it doesn't it would loose all relevance at high leves but it'd still be nice to have, ask your DM. <br><br> A Bralani get 'Blur' and 'Mirror Image' at will, both powerful combat buffs that further increases it's survavility, blur can be cast on allies. With caster level fixed at 6th an enemy spell caster would easily 'Dispel' them, consider having a 'Ring of Counter Spells' and a companion to refresh the contained spell, if that's not an option still the enemy would have invested some resources in dispelling these buffs. Also this monters has 'Charm Person' (synergizes well with 'Tongues'), 'Gust of Wind' and 'Wind Wall' at will, all these are fine utilities but will see little or no combat use, maybe as countermeasures vs. 'gas based attacks' and fogs. Finally, a Bralani can use twice per day 'Lighting Bolt' and 'Cure Serious Wounds', again, being fixed at CL 6th these spells will be lacking power, specially Lighting Bolt (6d6 dmg, reflex half). They still are an area damage option and an emergency heal. <br><br> <b> Alternate Form: </b> despite it's description ('...a whirlwind or zephyr of dust, snow, or sand', I picture it as a medium 'Air Elemental') it looks like 'Whirlwind Form' is not gaseous, per 'Alternate Form' description this form inherits most of the previous form game statistics. In Whirlwind Form you gain 100 ft. Fly Speed (perfect), which is great, a slam attack and 'Whirlwind Blast' (a short ranged line effect for 3d6, reflex half). You loose the ability to use weapons and, although it's not explicit, the ability to complete somatic spell components. Most of the gear used by the humanoid form it's likely to be non functional and even fall to the ground, check with your DM, maybe your gear could meld into your form while it's non functional. Anyhow, 'Whirlwind form' it's a great utility option and, if you find a work around with gear, a combat alternative. </p>",
